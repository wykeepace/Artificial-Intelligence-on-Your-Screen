# Artificial-Intelligence-on-Your-Screen
Come to learn and Contibute in technologies like Machine Learning, Artifical Intellience, Computer Graphics, Unity3D, Data Science and more. <br><br>
Hi,<br> 
Welcome to all the Contributors here we are looking forward with your particiaption on our project and we love Open Source Contibution.<br><br>
What we are trying to solve here is simple to say but very complex to build. We are trying to build an Artificial Intelligence that can easily interact with Us (Just like google Assistant but in more interactive way). Now, here things get messy and that's because we want to provide a face to our AI or You can say we want to give it an Identity so that we can see it on our display screens. Its like instead of replying to you with text massage it will reply to you with voice by speaker and it felt like someone talking to you. This will make AI more Interactive than it was before. And in future we want to convert this is holographic mode so that it can also present in real time which can be easily visible/seen by VRs, hololenses, etc.
<br>
I am hoping you like this Idea I want Contibutors to move forward and help us to complete this newly Intiated Project by Us.<br><br>
