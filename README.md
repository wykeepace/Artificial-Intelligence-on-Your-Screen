# Artificial-Intelligence-on-Your-Screen
Come to Contibute in ML,AI,Computer Graphics, etc
<br>Hey, 
Welcome to all the Contributors we are looking forward with your particiaption on our project and we love Open Source Contibution.
What we are trying to solve here is so simple to say but very complex to build. We are trying to build an Artificial Intelligence that can easily interact with Us (Just like google Assistant but more interactive).Here things get messy and that's because we want to give him a face or You can say we want to give it an Identity so that we can see it on our display screens. This will make AI more Interactive than before it was. And in future we want to convert this is holographic mode so that it can also present in real time which can be visible/seen by VRs, hololenses, etc.

I am hoping you like this Idea I want Contibutors to move forward and help us to complete this newly Intiated Project by Us.
